## Abstractions

    - Abstraction to deal with complexity
       - Hide lower-level detail
            - circuit -> gate
            - logic design: gate -> components (ALU, register file...)
            - system level
                - Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
            - Machine Language
                - Binary Code
            - Assembly
            - High Level Language (HLL)
            - Library Languages, GUI, etc
                - Makes the computer easier to use
                - C,A,B
                - C=A*B
    - Most important abstraction: Instruction set architecture
        - hardware/software interface
        - Includes anything a programmer needs to know to make a binary machine language
            - #instructions, formats, addressing modes,...
        - Decides workload b/w software & hardware
        - Want a good balance - optimum point
        - First step in designing a computer system
              - Huge effect on performance
    - Implementation: hardware that obeys the architecture abstract
      - An architecture can have several different implementations
      - Computer Architecture = ISA + underlying implementation

## Response Time and Throughput - Performance Analysis

      j1 j2 ..., ji ... jn
      t1 t2 ..., ti ... tn

    - Response Time
      - How long it takes to do a task

    - Throughput
      - Total work done per unit time
        - Tasks/transactions/etc per hour

          j1 j2 ..., ji ... jn
          t1 t2 ..., ti ... tn
          Throughput (sequential) = n/(t1+t2+...+tn)

    - How are response time and throughput affected by
      - Replacing processor with a faster version?
        - Both improved
      - Adding more processors
        - Doesn't improve response time - only one task per processor
        - Throughput improved - not sequential

          p1 j1 j3 ...
          p2 j2 j4 ...

## Measuring Execution Time

    - Elapsed Time
      - Total response time - all aspects
        - Processing, I/O, OS overhead, idle time
        - Memory access etc
      - Determines system perfromance
      - Random factors
    - CPU Time
      - Time spent processing a given job
        - Discounts I/O time, other jobs' shares
        - Deterministic
      - Execution time

## Relative Performance

    - Define performance = 1/Execution Time
    - X is n times faster than y
      - Px/Py = ETy/ETx = n
    - Ex: time to run a program
      - 10s on A, 15s on B

        A 10s Perf(A) = 1/10
        B 15s Perf(B) = 1/15

        Perf(A)/Perf(B) = 15/10 = 1.5

## CPU Clocking

    - Operation of digital hardware governed by a constant-rate clock
    - Synchronization of processes, for hardware as well
    - Clock Period: duration of a clock cycle
      - 1/4 -> 250 ps = 250 * 10^-12
    - Clock frequency (rate): cycles per second
      - 4.0 GHz = 4*10^9 cycles per second

## Clock Cycle vs Clock rate

    - Clock period = cycle time = cycle length
    - Clock rate = clock frequency
    - How are they related?
    - EX

      Clock rate = x cycles/sec
      Cycle time = 1/x sec = 1/Clock rate

## CPU Time

    CPU Time = CPU Clock Cycles * Clock Cycle Time = (CPU Clock Cycles)/(Clock Rate)

    execution time
    CPU Time = # cycles * cycle time
             = # Cycles/clock rate

    - Performance improved by
      - Reducing number of clock cycles
      - Increasing clock rate
      - Hardware designer must trade off clock rate against cycle count

## CPU Time Example

    - Computer A: 2GHz clock, 10s CPU time
    - Designing Computer B
      - Aim for 6s CPU time
      - Can do faster clock, but causes 1.2*clock cycles
    - How fast must Computer B clock be?

          CPU Time        Clock Rate           # Cycles
      A      10s        2*10^9 cycles/sec         x
      B       6s               y                 1.2x

              CPU Time = #cycles/clock rate
                10s = x/(2*10^9)
                x=10s*(2*10^9)
                6s = 1.2x/y
                y=1.2x/6
                 =1.2*10*2*10^9
                 =4*10^9
                 =4GHz
