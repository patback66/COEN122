# COEN 122 Computer Architecture 04_04_16

  Homework due Friday, 4/8
  Abstraction
    Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
  CPU Time = #cycles * cycle time
  CPU Time = #cycles/clock rate
    I1, I2, (I3, I4, I5) * 100, I6, I7
    #Inst = 3*100+4
          = 3*n+4

## Instruction Count and CPI

  Clock Cycles = Instruction Count * Cycles per Instruction
  CPU Time = Instruction Count * Clock Cycle Time
           = (Instruction Count * CPI) / Clock Rate

    - Instruction Count for a program
      - Determined by program, ISA, compiler, algorithm
    - Average Cycles per Instruction
      - Determined by CPU hardware
      - If different instruction, have different CPI
        - Average CPI affected by instruction mix

| Inst |  A  |  B  |  C  |  D  |
-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| %    | 15% | 10% | 20% | 55% |
| CPI  |  5  |  6  |  1  |  2  |

    Average CPI = #cycles/#instructions(x)
    #cycles = 15%x\*5 +10%x\*6 +20%x\*1
    +55%x*2 = x(0.75+0.6+0.2+1.1)
    =2.65x
    CPI = 2.65x/x = 2.65

## CPI in More Detail

    - If different instruction classes take different numbers of cycles
      - Clock cycles = sum(cpi*instruction count)
      - Weighted Average CPI

## CPI Example

    Computer A: Cycle Time = 250ps, CPI = 2.0
    Computer B: Cycle Time = 500ps, CPI = 1.2
    Same ISA
    Which is faster, and by how much?

    #instructions = x
    CPU time(A) = #cycles*(cycle time)
                = #instructions * CPI * 250 //use unit ps picoseconds 10^-12
                = 2.0*50x = 500x
    CPU time(B) = x * 1.2 * 500
                = 600x
    600x/500x = 1.2
    "Machine A is 1.2 times faster than machine B"

## CPI Example cont'd

    - Alternative compiled code sequences using instructions in classes A,B,C

|  Class   | A  | B  | C  |
|----------|----|----|----|
|    CPI   | 1  | 2  | 3  |
| IC seq 1 | 2  | 1  | 2  |
| IC seq 2 | 4  | 1  | 1  |

    seq 1: #inst=2+1+2=5
    CPU time(1) = 2\*1+1\*2+2\*3=10 cycles
    CPI: 10/5 = 2.0

    seq2: # inst = 4+1+1=6
    CPU time(2) = 4\*1 + 1\*2 + 1\*3=9 cycles
    CPI: 9/6 = 1.5

## Performance Summary

    CPU Time Instructions/Program * Clock cycles/Instruction * Seconds/Clock Cycle

    - Depends on
      - Algorithm: affects IC, possibly CPI
      - Programming language: affects IC, CPI
      - Compiler: affects IC, CPI
      - Instruction set architecture: affects IC, CPI, Tc

## One More Example

    - Use following instruction mix, find
      - % memory accesses for data
      - % memory accesses that are reads (vs. writes)

| Arithmetic | load | store | branch |
|------------|------|-------|--------|
|    50%     | 30%  | 15%   |   5%   |

    CPU - PC - Ref File
    Memory: Code - Data

    # instructions = x
    1) (#accesses for data)/(#memory accesses) = 0.45x/1.45x = 0.45/1.45
    2) (#accesses for reads)/(#memory accesses) = 1.3x/1.45x = 1.3/1.45

    #accesses = x + 30% + 15%x
              = 1.45x
    #accesses for data = 30%x + 15%x 0.45x

    #read operations = x + 30%x = 1.3x

## SPEC CPU Benchmark

    - Programs used to measure performance
      - Supposedly typical of actual workload
    - Standard Performance Evaluation Corp (SPEC)
      - Develops benchmarks for CPU, I/O, Web,...
    - Spec CPU2006
      - Elapsed time to execute a selection of programs
        - Negligible I/O, so focuses on CPU performance
      - Normalize relative to reference machine
      - Summarize as geometric mean of performance ratios
        - CINT2006(integer) and CFP2006(floating-point)

    19.2=9770/508
    25.7=root12(19.2 * 15.4... * 25.1)
