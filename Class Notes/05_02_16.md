# COEN 122 Computer Architecture 05_02_16

## From Last Time

    - 5 instructions at the same time with different stages
    - going through pipeline buffers
    - Given current state, give the instructions

## Graphically Representing Pipelines

    - 5 cycles + 1 * (each subsequent instruction)

## Pipeline Hazards

    - Structural hazard - hardware resource conflicts
      - like two try to use the ALU in the same cycle
      - in any stage, at any time, only 1 instruction is being processed
        - THIS IS OUR PIPELINE - IT IS STATIC
        - therefore we don't need to worry about it
        - BUT WE WILL HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT IN DYNAMIC PIPELINES
    - Data hazards - caused by data dependence
      - current instruction needs a value, have to read, generated by previous
      - overlapping execution
    - Control hazards - cause by branch/jump instructions

## Data dependence

    - I1: sub $2, $1, $3
    - I2: and $12, $2, $5
    - I3: or $13, $6, $2
    - I4: add $14, $2, $2
    - I5: sw $15, 100($2)

    - Data dpendence:
      - relation between 2 instructions which reference the same register
      - and one reference is a write, no other writes between
        - dependence needs to be direct

    - I1 $2 wrt
    - I2 Rd
    - I3 Rd
    - I4 Rd
    - I5 Rd
    - I1 -> I2 on $2 RAW, I2 Depends on I1
    - I1 -> I3 on $2 RAW
    - I1 -> I4 on $2 RAW
    - I1 -> I5 on $2 RAW

    - RAW - read after write dependence
    - WAR - write after read dependence
    - WAW - write after write dependence
    - RAR - read after read
      - don't really care here

    - Suppose adding I6
      - add $2, $16, $17
    - so new dependencies
      - I6 wrt
      - I2 -> I6 on $2 WAR
      - I3 -> I6 on $2
      - I4 -> I6 on $2 WAR
      - I5 -> I6 on $2 WAR

    - DDG - Data Dependence Graph
      - Each instruction corresponds to a law
      - img
      - sequential execution: data dependence won't cause issues
    - Data dependence does not cause any problem in non overlapped execution
    - Single cycle: execute all of the instructions in order
      - Important: don't start the next until the current is done
    - But pipeline has overlap


    - Need to look at when reg read and write occurs on the clock
      - order of read and write
      - option: pos clock: reg read, neg clock reg wrt
      - option: pos clock: reg wrt, neg clock reg read

    - now with I6
      - img
      - write in the last stage so WRA ok and WAW ok
      - only need to worry about RAW
    - number of cycles to resolve hazard: 2 cycles
      - aka penalty cycle
      - because dependence between
      - so new order
        - I1
        - nop
        - nop
        - I2
        - I3
        - I4
        - I5
        - I6

## How to Handle Data Dependence

    - Software: compiler approach
      - check code for dependencies
      - insert dummy operations or "nops" between the problems
      - Reschedule instructions
        - just have to respect data dependence
        - need independent in between
    - Hawdware approach
      - add more hardware
      - forwarding

## Compiler Approach 1 for data hazards

    - compiler generates code without data hazards by inserting dummy operations

    sub $2,$1,$3
    and $12, $2, $5
    or $13, $6, $2
    add $14, $2, $2
    sw $15, 100($2)

    - has data hazards, not allowed

    sub $2,$1,$3
    nop
    nop
    and $12, $2, $5
    or $13, $6, $2
    add $14, $2, $2
    sw $15, 100($2)

    - 2 nop cycles fixes this, but slows it down
    - better: utilize the time where the nops are with other indep. instructions

## Compiler Approach 2: Scheduling

    - move indep. instructions around to eliminate hazards and fill in bubbles
    - example, if there were more instructions

    I1 and $18, $9, $10
    I2 sub $2, $1, $3
    I3 and $12, $2, $5
    I4 or $13, $6,$2
    I5 add $14, $2, $2
    I6 sw $15, 100($2)
    I7 sub $16, $7, $8
    I8 add $17, $8, $9

    - so now
      - I2
      - I1
      - I7
      - I3
      - I4
      - I5
      - I6
      - I8
      - at least two instructions between dependent instructions
      - Doesn't lose performance
      - Hazard free
      - If there aren't enough indep. instructions, you have to insert dummy ops

## how to identify all dependence

    - Find all instructions that write registers
    - For each such instruciton writing register $j, identify all other instructions that either read or write register $j
    - I1 wrt $10
      - no other references to $18
    - I2 wrt $2
      - many other references to $2
    - $2 is the only data dependence that occurs

## Next time: hardware approach
