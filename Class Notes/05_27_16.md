# COEN 122 Computer Architecture

## From Last Time

    - Write policy
    - Performance Model
      - Consider penalty cycles due to cache miss

## Set Associative Cache -- Motivation

    - Block size: 1 word
    - Memory Size: 16 blocks
    - Cache size: 8 blocks
    - Access sequence: 0,8,0,8,0,8
    - Miss rate: 1
    - Reorganize cache such that each cache has two blocks
        - 2 way set associative
        - miss rate reduced
        - lose speed, more flexibility
    - 2-way set associative
        - a cache that has 2 locations where each block can be placed

## Associative Caches

    - Fully associative
        - allow a given block to go in any cache entry
        - requires all entries to be searched at once
        - comparator per entry (expensive)
    - n-way set associative
        - each set contains n entries
        - block number determines which set
            - (block number) % (#sets in cache)
        - seaerch all entries in a given set at once
        - n comparators (less expensive)

## Comparison of 2 Caches with 8 words

    - direct mapped cache with block size=2
        - cache index: 2 bits
        - block size = 2
        - 4 cache sets, each set has one block of 2 words sharing same tag
        - address translation
    - 2-way set associative
        - block size = 1
        - cache index: 2 bits
        - 4 cache sets, each set has two blocks with different tags
        - use replacement policy
        - address translation
        - #sets =  8 / (2+2) = 2
            - cache index = 1 bit

    - fully associative
        - one set - no index
        - block size = 2

## Example: two-way set associative vs direct
