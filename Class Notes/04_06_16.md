# COEN 122 Computer Architecture 04_06_16

## From Last Time

  CPUtime = #instructions * CPI / Clock rate

  Instruction count

  CPI = Average Cycles per instruction
      = #cycles / #instructions

  MIPS

    - Performance metric, instruction execution rate
    - name of our ISA
    - name of a company

## Pitfall: MIPS as a Performance Metric

    - MIPS: Millions of instructions per seconds
      - Doesn't account for
        - Differences in ISA's between computers
        - Differences in complexity between instructions
      - CPI varies between programs on a given CPU

    MIPS = Instruction count / (Execution time * 10^6)
         = Instruction count / (((instruction count * CPI)/clock rate) * 10^6)

    Benchmark             A                   B
                        x inst              10x inst
                        100 MIPS            100 MIPS

## Example

    - 2 machines
      - A: floating point hardware
      - B: no FP, instructions take 2 cycles
    - Clock rate of 500 Ghz
    - CPIs for both?
      - A
        - X
        - CPI = #cycle/#inst = 10%(6)+15%(4)+5%(20)+70%(2) = 3.6
      - B
        - y
        - 2y/y = 2
    - MIPS for both?
      - MIPS = clockrate/(CPI*10^6)
      - A
        - MIPS = (500 * 10^9)/(3.6 * 10^6) = 500/3.6 * 10^3
      - B
        - MIPS = (500 * 10^9)/(2 * 10^6) = 250*10^3
    - If A needs n instructions for program P, how many integer instructions does B require?
      - A
        - n
      - B
        - y = 10%(n)(30) + 15%(n)(20) + 5%(n)(50) + 70%(n)(1)
        - = 9.2n
          - Instruction count for B is 9.2 times that of A
    - CPU times of P on A & B? Which is faster?
      - A
        - CPU time = #inst * cpi/clockrate = n * 3.6/(500 * 10^9)
      - B
        - CPU time = 9.2n * 2 / (500 * 10^9) =
      - Both
        - CPU(A)/CPU(B) = 9.2 * 2 / 3.6 = 5.11
        - Choose machine A

## Concluding Remarks

    - Hierarchical layers of abstraction
      - In both hardware and software
    - ISA

## ON TO CHAPTER 2

## MIPS R3000 Instruction Set Architecture

    - Registers: 32 general purpose registers ($0 - $31)
      - $zero(0):0
    - 3 Special purpose
      - PC: program counter
      - Hi, Lo for multiply and divide
    - 2 remarks: register 2:
      - $2 vs 2
        - $2 value inside register 2, 32 bits
        - 2 address, 5 bits (32 = 2^5)
      - $t2 vs $2

## Memory Operands

    - Memory is byte addressed
      - Each address identifies an 8-bit byte
    - Words are aligned in memory
      - Address must be a multiple of 4
    - MIPS is Big Endian
      - Most-significant byte at least address of a word
      - c.f. Little Endian: least-significant byte at least address

## MIPS ISA: Instruction Categories

    - Arithmetic & logic (AL)
      - add $1,$2,$3 #$1\<-$2+$3
      - sub
    - Load/Store
    - Control purpose

## Representing Inst. in Computer

    - Instruction format: layout of the instruction
    - 3 types of formats
      - R-type (regular)
      - I-type (immediate)
      - J-type (Jump)
    - R-type: 6 fields
      - op: operation code
      - rs: 1st register source operand
      - rt: 2nd register source operand
      - rd: register destination
      - sa: shift amount
      - function: select the variant of operation in op field

## Instruction format R-Type Example

    - Ex: add $8,$17,$18
    - (0 | 17 | 18 | 8 | 0 | add(32))
      - $8\<-$17+$18
    - (op|rs|rt|rd|sa|func)
    - (000000|10001|10010|01000|00000|1000000)

    - sub $1,$2,$3  #$1\$2-$3
    - (0|2|3|1|0|sub(34))
    - (000000|00010|00011|00000|1000100)

    - Other r-type inst.
      - sub $1,$2,$3
      - slt $1,$2,$3
      - jr $ra(31)
      - (0|2|3|1|0|slt(42))
      - (000000|00010|00011|00000|101010)
