## Final Quiz Monday

## Pipeline

    - all use 2 stores to resolve hazard
    - lw -> 3 cycles
    - don't treat differently in basic version
    - Pipeline CPI Estimation
    - Memory Hierarchy
    - Different types of cache
      - Direct mapped cache
      - full associative
      - set associative
    - 4 Questions to know about cache
      - Address mapping from lower level to upper level
      - Address translation
      - Which block to be replaced (handle write)
        - eviction
      - Write?

    - cache size = 2^r words
      - cache index (address) has r bits
    - block size = 1
    - memory address x_31 x_30 ... x_1 x_r-1 x_r-2 .. x_0
                                          - cache index

## Different Block Size

    - in general, block size is a power of 2
    - How to form blocks: memory locations with the same block address

  Concepts

    - block address
      - common part
    - block offset
      - differing part

  Block size = 2

    - memory size = 32 = 2^5 words
    - [00000], [00001], [00010], ...
    - group same block addresses together -> block address is first 4 bits here
      - so 0000 and 0000 and 0001 are block addresses
      - want to group 00000 and 00001 together
      - the one that is different is the block offset
    - assume cache size = 8 words
      - 8/2 = 4 blocks
    - assume memory size = 32 words
      - 32 / 2 = 16 blocks
    - so cache index has 2 bits
      - for address translation
    - so cache:
      - | 00 | 01 | 10 | 11 |
        - each holds 2 words
      - memory
        - | 00000 | 00001 | ... | 11111 |
      - 4 memory blocks share the same cache location
        - nonconsecutive blocks
      - cache:
        - | 0000 | 00010 | 0011 | 0100 }
      - blocks with address
        - 0000
        - 0100
        - 1000
        - 1100
        - all these share the cache location 00
    - address translation
      - memory address x_4 x_3 x_2 x_1 x_0
        - x_0 is the block offset
        - x_1, x_2 is the cache index
        - x_4, x_3 is the tag

## Direct Mapped Cache -- Address translation

    - memory address with 2 bits byte offset
    - 2^r
      - implies cache index has r bits
    - 2^b
      - implies block offset has b bits
    - Address translation: how to figure out cache index from the memory address
    - x_1 x_0 = byte offset
    - X_... x_2
      - b bits block offset
    - x_i ...
      - r bits cache index
    - x_31 x_31 ...
      - tag
    - #bit of tag = 32 - r - b - 2 = 30 - r - b
    - How many bits needed to implement the above cache?
      - 2^r blocks
      - each block: 1(valid) + (30-r-b)(tag) + 2^b * 32
        - = 31 - r - b + 2^b * 32
      - #bit of tag = 32 - r - b - 2 = 30 - r - b
      - total # bits = 2^r * size(each block)
        - = ((31 - r - b) + 2^b * 32) * 2^r

    - THIS IS ON THE TEST

## DMA - MIPS

    - takes advantage of temporal locality
    - How many bits to implement?
      - | valid (1) | tag (20) | data (32) |
      - 1 + 20 + 32 = 53
      - #bits(cache) = 53 * 2^10 bits

## 64 Kb DMA

    - 2^12 * 2^2 = 2^14 words = 2^14 * 2^2 bytes
      - = 2^16 bytes == 64 * 2^10 bytes
    - need a mux to select from the 4 words -> delay
      - Spatial locality!
    - DMA block size 1 has lowest average access time
    - DON'T INCLUDE THE INDEX - YOU DON'T SAVE IT, IT DOESN'T TAKE UP SPACE

## Sample Quiz

    1)
      - 2 * 8 word blocks (16 words total)
      - index | v | tag | d0 | d1 | d2 | ... | d7|
      - 0 | | | | | ...|
      - 1 | | | | | ...|
    2)
      - ignore -> set associative
    3)
      - calculate number bits needed to implement
