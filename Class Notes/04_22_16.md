# COEN 122 Computer Architecture

## QUIZ 2 ON MONDAY! DO HW3 but no turn in

    - Diagram will be given

## From Last Time

    - Single Cycle datapath
    - Execution Time

## Excercise: Cycle time

    - Data analysis
    - Assume
      - ALU delay=2ns
      - Adder (PC+4) delay = x ns
      - Adder (branch address) delay = y ns

    R-type: x
      2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 --> execution time max[x,8]
      IF Reg ALU  REG

    beq: max(x,2)   +   y
         2 + 2 + 2  = 6
         IF REG ALU
         so max[6, max[x,2] + y]
         because we have more parallel things going on

    lw

    sw

    x=1, y=9
      so R = 9 ns cycle time
      beq = 11 ns cycle time

## Review Quiz 2

    - Don't memorize the table
      - Pay attention to the control names/orders
      - Mux may be reversed

    2) label -> wai 5
      - $5 \<- label

    3) Assume we have a single stuck-at-1 fault for ALUsrc
        + ALUsrc = 1 always
          - what works still? consider only 5 instructions
            - look at R, lw, sw, beq, jump
            - I-type instructions will work
              - lw works
              - sw works
              - j works
        + Zero=1
          - R-type will work
          - lw will work
          - sw will work
          - jump will work
          - BRANCH WILL NOT

## Pipeline - will be on the quiz

### Pipeline - Outline

    - Basic idea
    - Pipelined datapath
    - Pipelined control
    - Data hazards
    - Three methods to handle data hazards - use compiler

### Instruction fetch

    - lw -> | 2ns | Reg/ID | Ex | mem | wrtBk |
          - | IF  | ID     | EX |     | WB    |
          - | 2ns | 2ns    | 2ns| 2ns | 2ns   |
    - speedup will be 5, buffer between stages
    - 10 ns total

### Basic idea of pipelining

    - roughly 5 steps for single cycle
      - IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB
    - For the current step, hardware for other steps are idle
    - Use the idle hardware to work on other instructions

### MIPS Pipe: 5 stages

    - IF: instruction fetch
    - ID: instruction decode and register fetch
    - EX: address calculation/excecute
    - MEM: memory access
    - WB: write back
    - USE BUFFERS between modules

### Pipelining: Control

    - control passed through buffers between modules
    - Size of buffer: 32 for instruction, 64 for PC+4
      - so IF/ID buffer size 64
      - ID/EX buffer size 32 * 4 + 5 (5 from read register)
      - EX/MEM buffer size 32 * 3 + 1 + 5
      - MEM/WB buffer size 32 * 2 + 5

### Pipeline Control

    - We have 5 stages, What needs to be controlled with each stage?
      - IF and PC++ << no control
      - ID/Reg      << no control
      - Exec        << ALUsrc, ALUop(2), and RegDst can be moved to here
      - Mem         << mRd, mWrt, branch
      - WB          << regwrt, regDst, memtoReg
    - Generate all control signals in the ID stage and pipeline them
