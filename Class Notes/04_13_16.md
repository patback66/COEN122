## From Before

  MIPS ISA
    ALU add $1,$2,$3
    Data transfer
      lw $1,200($2)
      sw $4,400($5)
    Control
      bne $5,$6,500
      beq
      jump
      slt
      jr
      jal
    R,I,J
    Addressing Modes
      register
      displacement
      pseudodirect
      pc

## ISAs

  RISC
    Reduced Instruction Set Computer
  CISC
    Complicated Instruction Set Computer
  Trade off between too simple, and too complex
    Good performance vs hard to use

## Basic ISA Classes

    - Accumulator
      - 1 address add A # acc <- acc + mem[a]
    - Stack (special purpose register)
      - 0 address add # tos <- tos + next
    - General purpose register
      - 2 address add A,B # loc(A) <- loc(A) + loc(B)
      - 3 address add A,B,C # loc(A) <- loc(B) + loc(C)
      - memory/memory #mem(a) <- mem[b] + mem[c]
      - memory/register #$1 <- $1 + mem[c]
      - register/register -- load/store (our MIPS) #$1 <- $2 + $3

## Fallacies

    - Powerful instruction -> higher performance
      - Fewer instructions required in the code
      - But complex instructions are hard to implememtn
        - May slow down all instructions, inluding simple ones
      - Compilers are good at making fast code from simple instructions

## Example

    - add new powerful al instruction to
      - reduce 25% al instructions
      - 10% increase cycle time
    - Instructions
      - AL: 1 CPI, 500m I count
      - Load/store: 10 CPI, 300m I count
      - Branch: 3 CPI, 100m I count

    T(A) = # cycles * (cycle time) //cycle time = t_a
         = (500e6 * 1 + 300e6 * 10 + 100e6 * 3)t_a
         = t_a * 10^6 * 3800

    T(B) = ((1-25%) * 500e6 + 300e6 * 10 + 100e6 * 3) * 1.1t_a
         //t_b = 1.1t_a
         =

    T(A)/T(B) = 4042.5/3800 > 1
    SO NO, NOT A GOOD CHOICE

## Chapter Summary

    - MIPS ISA
      - 3 Categories: ALU, data transfer, branch, and jump
      - 3 Instruction types: R,I,J
      - 5 Addressing modes: register, base, immediate, PC relative, pseudodirect
    - Other ISA

## CHAPTER 4 BEGINS

  The Processor: Datapath & Control

    - Two implementations of MIPS instruction architecture
      - Single cycle implementation
        - Datapath and control
      - Pipeline implementation
        - Datapath & control
        - Data dependence/Hazard
    - Consider only the core MIPS inst. set
      - memory-reference inst. lw,sw
      - ALU inst
      - branch

## The Performance Perspective

    - Performance of a machine is determinded by:
      - Instruction count
      - Clock cycle time
      - Clock cycles per instruction
    - Processor design (datapath and control) will affect:
      - Clock cycle time
      - Clock cycles per instruction
    - Single cycle processor
      - A simple start to understand more complicated pipeline implementation

## Functional Units for implementing instructions

    - instruction memory,program counter all 32 bits
    - dmu: write data, address, read data 32 bits
      - MemWrite, MemRead 1 bit
    - Registers
      - 3 ops in 1 cycle
      - Others are only 1 op per cycle
      - Read data 1, Read data 2, Write data 32 bits
      - 2 reads, 1 write in the same cycle
      - Read operation
      - Write ..
      - Read on up of clock
      - write on second up of clock/down portion
