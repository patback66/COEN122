## Cache -- Summary

    - Three Address mapping
        - Direct
            - only one place to go
        - Set associative
            - n places to go
        - Fully associative
            - go anywhere
    - Cache Performance
        - Penalty cycles due to cache miss
        - Average penalties per instruction
        - Average cache miss penalty
        - memory access time
        - AMAT

## Virtual Memory

    - Main Memory
    - Virtual Memory (disk)
        - Pages = Block in cache
        - Page Frame
        - Fully associative - go anywhere that's available
        - Goal: size
        - Page size = 2^b
        - Address mapping:
            - fully associative
                - compare the tags for every block
        - Page table - address translation
            - virtual address to physical address
            - Physical address to cache address
        - TLB
            - hardware, finds recent pages
        - Page:
            - a virtual memory block
        - Page fault: a memory miss
        - Virtual address physciall address adderss translation

    Ex

        | Virtual page # | Page Offset | < - Virtual Address
        |                | 12 bits     |
        {translation}
        | Physical page # | Page offset| < - Physical Address
            - Address: byte addressible

    Page Table
        Blocks:
        | Virtual Page Number | Dirty Bit | Physical Page # |

## Addressing Mappings and Address Translation

    - Fully associative
        - a page can go to any page frame in physical memory
    - Page table
        - tells if a page is in physical memory, if it is in, provides the physical address
        - each program has a page table
        - page table stored in main memory
    - Page table register
        - pointing to the page table

## Calculating Size

    - Virtual memory size: 2^20 pages, 2^(20+12) bytes
    - Physical memory size: 2^18 pages, 2^30 bytes
    - Page table size: 2^20 * (1(valid) + 18(PPN))
        - = 2^20 * 19

## Page Table

    - Valid bit
        - 1 : page table item indicates the phyusical page number
        - 0 : page table item indicates the location on disk
            - have a page fault
            - bring the page from disk to main memory
            - insert the physical page # into the page table

## Replacement Policy

    - Page Faults
        - how to find the missing page on disk?
        - choosing a page to replace? LRU scheme
    - LRU - replace the Least Recently Used
        - reference bit in page table: each time a page is accessed, ref bit
            - set ref bit = 1; OS periodically clears ref. bit

## Writes

    - Write throug does not work
        - big page -- 4 kbytes
        - takes 100 - 1000 cycles to write disk (startup penalty)
    - Write back:
        - individual writes are accumulated into a page
        - the page is copied back to disk only when the page is replaced
    - Dirty bit
        - 1 if the page has ben written
        - 0 if the page never changed
        - Each entry contains
            - | Valid | Reference | Dirty | Physical page # |

## How to make address translation faster

    - One step in address translation
        - use virtual page number to access page table - access amin mem to translate address
    - Another cache to hold part translation items in the page table -- TLB
    - Memory
        - code -> I-code
        - data -> d-cache
        - page table -> TLB

    - Typical values:
        - 16-512 entries
        - miss-rate .01-1%
        - miss-penalty 0 - 100 cycles

## Example

    - Byte addressable
    - Virtual address:
        - Virtual page Number | Page Offset
        - 20 - 10 = 10 Bits | 10 Bits
    - Page size: 2^10 bytes
    - TLB index: 3 bits
    - TLB tag < - > Virtual Page number
        - 10 bits
    - How many entries in a page table?
        - = how many virtual pages
        - 2^10
        - each virtual page has an entry - how many different ones are there?
    - Page address
        - Physical page number | Page offset
        - 18-10 = 8 | 10
