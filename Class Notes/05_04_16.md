# COEN 122 Computer Architecture 05_04_16

## NO CLASS NEXT WEDNESDAY

## MIDTERM 3 ON MONDAY

## Project

    - Data dep. data dep graph
    - Data hazards (RAW)
    - Compiler approaches
      - make it hazard free

## Hardware Solution: Forwarding

    - need to be stored for dependency - in pipeline this might not have happened
      - cycle too close together
      - Execution memory
      - value is generated but not yet stored
    - so use forwarding
      - multiplexer to select the value
      - use the 20 instead of the 10 -> choose with mux
      - it wasn't yet stored but it is usable in this sort of "buffer"
    - resolves the hazard without losing cycles
    - this is a new data dependence, on runtime

    - What's going on?
        - AND $12, $2, $5
            - use forwarding, compare write and read addresses, control multiplexer
            - take register write as an input

## Forwarding Unit

    - compares the 2 read addresses of the instruction in EX with write addresses of MEM and WB
    - Input
      - rs and rt in ID/EX
      - rd or rt and regwrt in ex/mem
      - rd or rt and regwrt in mem/wb
    - Out
      - forward a to control top mux before alu
      - forward b to control the bottom mux before alu

## Can't always forward

    - need hazard detection
    - look at memory reads right after instruction decode
      - mem read is only for lw
      - WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING SPECIAL
    - Label inputs/outputs in test 3
