# COEN 122 Computer Architecture

## MONDAY TEST 3

## WEDNESDAY NO CLASS, FRIDAY HAS CLASS

    DO HW 5 TO PREPARE, DON'T HAVE TO TURN IN

## Hazard Detection - From Last Time

    - Forwarding Unit
      - Function to compare 2 read addresses of an instruction (write) before
        - execution, if max, have data dependence
    - Load Word Dependence
      - Hazard detection

  Data hazard Summary

    - Data dependence
      - raw, war, waw
    - Data hazard caused by Raw
    - To Resolve
      - Compiler approach
      - Hardware forwarding
        - ALU forwarding
        - Special case: dependence on lw
          - hazard detection unit for that

## Branch Hazards

  Ex

    - branch address = PC + 4 + 7 * 4
                  -  = 40 + 4 + 28 = 72
    - if branch is not take, ok
    - But if taken there are 3 wrong instructions already in the pipe
      - FLUSH THEM ALL
        - lose 3 cycles
    - How to handle
      - 2 Hardware schemes
        - Static: always assume the branch is taken
        - Dynamic: branch prediction
      - Software
        - 3 NOPS after each branch instruction
      - One optimization
        - Move branch addr calculation and condition test to ID stage
          - 3 lost cycles become 1
          - use right after regFile, test in execution stage
            - but move to in ID too
            - register delay is 1ns, can be moved
            - ALU is 2 ns, IF is 2 ns so they'res time
            - Use a bitwise comparison rather than subtraction
            - RCA will be slow
            - beq $1, $2, 7
              - $1 = $2
              - XOR -> equal then branch
              - use a comparator right after reg file
                - gives the zero flag
      - One software scheme:
        - branch delay slot
        - Compiler inserts an instruction directly after a branch
          - independent of the branch instruction
          - No matter if the branch is taken or not, that instruction should always be executed

  Delayed Branch

    - a type of branch instruction where the isntruction immediately following
    - the branch is ALWAYS executed independent no matter if branch is taken or not

  Flushing Instructions

    - AND(Branch, Zero) gives if we should flush
    - F = 1 IFF Zero = 1 && Branch = 1
    - Use F to control
      - F = 1: PC < - Branch Address
      - multiplexer controlled by F connected between buffer and IM
      - If 1, flush -> dummy op, 32 0's
      - Then the IM doesn't have a chance to be written into the buffer
    - DON'T DO MULTIPLE APPROACHES TO RESOLVE
      - EITHER DELAY BRANCH OR HARDWARE APPROACH
      - THIS IS COVERED IN TEST 3
