## Pipelines

    - Basic
      - lots of bugs
    - Advanced
      - With flushing, hazard detection

## Calculating CPI of our Pipeline - Basic

|      a       | load | store | r-type | branch | jumps |
|--------------|------|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| gcc inst mix | 22 % | 11%   | 49%    | 16%    | 2%    |

    - no hazard: CPI = 1, assume no branch
    - Assume
        - half of lw immediated followed by a dependent instruction
        - 75% branches taken
        - jump treated as a taken branch
        - 30% R type have a dependence with following inst

    - R:
      - Instruction count = x, 70% 49% x
        - 1 CPI for these - # of R type without dependence
      - #R with dep (.3 * .49 * x * 3)
      - #R without dep (.7 * .49 * x)1
      - so (.7 * .49 * x)1 + (.3 * .49 * x * 3) = total cycles r type
      + # cycles(r) = (.7 * .49 * x)1 + (.3 * .49 * x * 3)
    - lw:
      - (.5 * .22 * x)1 = #lw no dependence
      - (.5 * .22 * x)3 = #lw with dep
      + # cycles(lw) = (.5 * .22 * x)1 + (.5 * .22 * x)3
    - sw
      + #cycles(sw) = .11 * x * 1
    - beq
      - (.25 * .16 * x)1 = # didn't take the branch
      - (.75 * .16 * x)4 = #that do take the branch
      + # cycles(beq) = (.25 * .16 * x)1 + (.75 * .16 * x)4
    - Jump
      - #cycles(j) = .2 * 4

    - CPI of basic pipeline
        - CPI = #cycles/x
        - cancel out x
          - .49(.7 * 1 + .3 + 3) + .22(.3 * 1 + .3 * 3) + .11 + .16(.25 + .75 * 4) + .2 * 4 = 1.934

    - CPI of the advanced pipeline

## Calculating CPI of our Pipeline - Advanced

    - R
      - #cycles(R) = .49 * x * 1
      - has forwarding, so all = 1
    - lw
      - .22 * x(.5 * 1 + .50 * 2)
      - needs 1 stall still
    - sw
      - .11 * 1
    - b
      - .16 * x(.25 * 1 + .75 * 2)
    - j
      - .2 * 2

    - CPI
      - = 1.25

## Improving Performance

    - Dynamic Pipeline Scheduling
      - Hardware chooses which instructions to execute next
      - Execute out of order (doesn't wait for a dep to be resolved, keeps going)
      - 3 O's
        - out of order issue
        - out of order execution
        - out of order completion
      - Trying to exploit instruction-level parallelism

## Example

  asm
  mov $5, $0
  SUM:
  lw $10, 1000($20)
  add $5, $5, $10
  addi $20, $20, -4
  bne $20, $0, SUM

    - I1 -> I3 on $5, RAW
    - I2 -> I3 on $10, RAW
    - I4 -> I5 on $20, RAW

  Basic Pipeline
    I1            once
    sum:          n times
    I2
    nop
    nop
    I3
    I4
    nop
    nop
    I5
    nop
    nop
    nop

      - number cycles: 11n + 1

    - This is bad: had to add 7 nops
    - Try to reorder for final project
    - swap I3, I4

## Concluding Remarks

    - Big Picture
      - Pipelines imrpove inst. throughput but not latency
      - Benefit limited by
        - data and control dependencies
      - Upper limit can be raised (not eliminated) by reducing data and control hazards
    - Compiler writers must understand pipeline
      - compiler techniques to reduce data and control hazards

## Memories

    - RAM - random access memory
    - Associative memory

    - SRAM
      - value is stored on a pair of inverting gates
      - very fast but takes up more space than DRAM (4 to 6 transistors)
      - faster, more expensive, smaller(number able to use)
      - implement cache
    - DRAM
      - Value is stored as a charge on capacitor (must be refreshed)
      - Very small but slower than SRAM (factor of 5 to 10)
      - implement main memory

## Memory Hierachy

    - Going up the pyramid: speed, cost increases
    - Going down the pyramid: size increases
    - Upper level & lower level
    - any upper level is a subset of the lower level
    - cache coherence - need to worry about other copies
      - keep modifications consistent
