# Coen 122 Computer Architecture

    Test 2 on Monday, Homework 3 should be done but not submitted

## Datapath for beq

    - Basic steps
      - Fetch the instruction
      - select registers
      - test condition, calculate branch address (need additional ALU)

    beq $1,$2,200
      Teset: $1=$2?
      PC \<- branch addr.
        branch addr. = PC + 4 + 200*4

    INST[25-21] -> RA1(rs)
    INST[20-16] -> RA2(rt)
    INST[15-0] -> signext 200() -> 32 bit so shift 2 left, add with pc+4
    $1 -> ALU
    $2 -> ALU
    ALU sub, -> result
      we want the z flag
    ALU needed for branch addr

    Only does branch instructions

## Creating a single datapath

    Use ALU to calculate memory address

    Key Differences

      - 2nd Input ot ALU
        - Mux before second input to ALU
      - Value written into register file
        - mux before WD
      - Register write
        - mux before WA
      - address
      - WILL NEED MULTIPLEXER TO SELECT INPUTS

## Simple Datapath for single cycle

    - can execute basic instructions in a single clock cycle
    - No resource can be used more than once during a single cycle
    - Need control lines -> memToReg for wd mux
      - ALUSrc for alu mux
      - PCSrc,
      - RegDst on Write register

## Single-Cylce: Control

    - Main Control
      - input: 6-bit from op field
      - output: 9 control lines
    - ALU control
      - input: ALU op + 6-bit (function field)
      - output: 3 lines
      - for I,J type, ALU control depends on only ALUop

    add $1,$2,$3
    |op|2|3|1|0|func|

    lw $4,20($5)
    |lw|5|4|20|

    addi $6,$7,200
    |addi|7|6|200|

## Control

    - regdst, regwrt, memtoreg are regwrt op control group
    - alusrc, aluop1, aluop0 are alu ops group
    - brch, MemRead, MemWrite are mem control group

| Instruction | RegDst | RegWrt | MemToReg | Brch | MemRead | MemWrite | ALUSrc | ALUOp1  | ALUp0   |
|-------------|--------|--------|----------|------|---------|----------|--------|---------|---------|
| R-Format    | 1      | 1      | 0        | 0    | 0       | 0        | 0      | 1 (R)   | 0 (R)   |
| lw          | 0      | 1      | 1        | 0    | 1       | 0        | 1      | 0 (add) | 0 (add) |
| sw          |        |        |          |      |         |          |        |         |         |
| beq         |        |        |          |      |         |          |        |         |         |

    sub$1,$2,$3
      $1 \<- $2-$3

    add

    lw $1,200($2)
      $1 \<- mem[$2+200]

END
