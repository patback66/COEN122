## Quiz 2

    Retake: 70.65 * 70% + new score * 30%
         ex 70 * 70% + 100 * 30% = 79

## Execution (cycle) Time Analysis

    - NEED TO USE MAXIMUM for the sections
    - Cycle time - the whole cycle, there's only 1
    - cycle time ex: max{x, 8ns}
    - max of all execution times as well

## Pipelining -- Control

    - use drive state

## Pipeline Control

    - IF and PC+
      - no control
    - ID/RF
      - no control
    - Exec
      - aluop, alusrc, (regDst)
    - Mem Stage
      - mrd, mwrt, brnch
    - Write Back
      - regwrt, regdst (move to exec), memtoReg

## Pipeline Control Components

    - Pass on to next section

## Pipeline: Datapath + Control

    - No data hazard handling
    - need to watch for delay

    IF/ID
      - 32 * 2 = 64 bits
      - Multiple control lines

    ID/EX
      - 32 * 4 + 5 * 2 + 4 + 3 + 2

    Ex/Mem
      - 32 * 3 + (5 + 1) + 3 + 2 = 107

    Mem/WB
      - 32 * 2 + 5 + 2 = 71

    (PICS SHOULD BE ADDED FROM 04_27_16)

    Ex:
      ALUop(2), ALUsrc(1), RegDst(1) >> 4 bits total
      M: Mrd, Mwrt, Brnch >> 3 bits total
      WB: Regwrt, MemToReg >> 2 bits

## Ex: how add $1,$2,$3 through the pipe

    - $1 << $2 + $3
    - Address of add $1,$2,$3 is 20
      - so PC + 4 = 24
    - IF/ID
      - 24, add, $1, $2, $3
        - | 0 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 0 | 32 |
              - end can be interpreted as 1 constant, get sign extended
    - ID/EX
      - control signlas, 24, $2, $3, x, 3, 1
      - RegDst, ALuOp, AluSrc
        - 1, 10, 0
      - WB
        - Regwrt, MemtoReg
          - 1, 0
      - Mem
        - Branch, Mrd, Mwrt
          - 0, 0, 0

    - Look at lw for more going on at each stage

## Performance

    - Execution time of execution, lw instructions
    - Speedup
    - CPI

  Ex:

    - adder/alu 2ns
    - Reg file: 1ns
    - Mem (I/D) 2ns
    - Critical path: 2ns
    - so cycle time of pipeline is 2ns
      - cover the longest operation
    - scc:
      - lw: im, rf, alu, dm, rf
        - 2, 1, 2, 2, 1 >> sum = 8ns
      - cycle time = 8 ns

  Ex: Execution of execution n load word instructions

    - SCC: ex time = 8 ns
    - Pipeline:
      - 1st lw: 5 cycles
        - each stage 1 cycle
      - after, assume no dependency, say 1 instruction done after each cycle
      - remaining n-1 lw: 1 cycle each
      - time(pipe) = 5 + (n-1) cycles
        - = (4 + n) * 2 ns
    - Speedup
      - speedup = time(scc)/time(pipe) = 8ns / ()(4+n) * 2ns) = 4 as n -> infinity
        - = 4n/(4+n) -> 4, as n-> infinity
      - Speedup is limited by number of stages
    - CPI = # cycles/#instructions <= # stages
      - = n/(4+n) -> 1, as n-> infinity
