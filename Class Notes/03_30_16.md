## Chapter 1

    - Emphasis on performance

  The Computer Revolution

    - Moore's Law -> more performance, increase as size decreases

  Classes of Computer

    - Personal
    - Server
    - Supercomputers
    - Embedded computers

  What You Will Learn

    - How the hardware executes machine code
    - Hardware implementation of software
    - Hardware/software interface
    - What is program performance?
    - How hardware designers improve performance
    - What is parallel processing

  Understanding Performance

    - Algorithm
    - PL, compiler, architecture
    - Processor and memory system
    - I/O system (will skip this in class)

  Eight Great Ideas

    - Design for Moore's law
    - Use abstraction to simplify design
    - Make the common case fast
    - Performance via parallelism
    - Performance via pipelining
    - Performance via prediction
    - Hierarchy of memory
    - Dependability via redundancy

  Below Your Program

    - Application Software
    - System Software
      - Compiler - translates HLL code to Assembly
        - Assembler translates Assembly into hardware code/machine code
      - Kernel
    - Hardware

  Levels of Program Code

    - High-level language
    - Assembly language
    - Hardware representation
      - Executable? no - binary is not executable
      - Need to run a linker
      - Chapter 2.13 -> how to make binary be executable

  5 Important Components of a Computer

    - Input
    - Output
    - Memory
    - Data path
    - Control

  Inside the Processor (CPU)

    - For this class: Design of memory, datapath, control
